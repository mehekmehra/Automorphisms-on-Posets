# Automorphisms-on-Posets
Finds all automorphisms on a given poset. Determines all of the possible permutations that are automorphisms and counts them. 
Additionally, there is a checker that takes in a poset and a permutation, and then determines if the permutation is an automorphism

automorphismSimple is a more automated checker in which you just run automorphism() in the terminal and you will get prompts for inputs.
automorphismSimple and automorphismsFinal both have the same functionality. However, automorphismSimple requires less work while inputting
the poset.
